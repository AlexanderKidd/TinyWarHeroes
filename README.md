A real-time strategy tactics game made within 6-7 hours in Javascript and HTML5.
Interestingly enough, it plays out like rock-paper-scissors, but with a possible 
time delay, randomness, and space variation (3 lanes to move in) that make it more challenging.
However, much of the calibration was left to still be rather random, although easy enough to
score a few points having read the instructions.

To run, download the folder and simply open the html file inside in a modern (Chrome, Firefox, Edge) browser.
Instructions on how to play are included on the html file/page.
